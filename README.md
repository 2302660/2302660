# Hi, I'm Ziyang 


I have foundation in AI and Data. With a hands-on approach to problem-solving, I have led and contributed to many meaningful projects spanning content moderation, emotion recognition, and visualising the world biggest data breaches.

My interests lie in the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Data Engineering, turning complex datasets into actionable insights.  



## Technical Skills

- **Languages:** Python, R, SQL  
- **Frameworks & Tools:** PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, RStudio, Tidyverse, Quarto, NoSQL, pgAdmin 4, MongoDB, MariaDB, Hugging Face, HTML/CSS, PHP/JavaScript, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, GitHub
- **Areas of Interest:** Data Analysis, LLMs, Data Engineering & Visualization.



## Core Projects

- **[Multimodal LLM-Based Profanity Detection](https://github.com/2302660/profanity-detection.git)**  
  Designed a context-aware content moderation system for both audio and text using LLMs and real-time streaming.
  
- **[FoodVision](https://github.com/2302660/aai3001_final_project.git)**  
  Deep learning-based food detection system using YOLOv8 to identify 55 different food classes, with calorie estimation and a web interface featuring image upload and camera capture capabilities.

- **[Speech Emotion Recognition with Wav2Vec2](https://github.com/2302660/Speech-Emotion-Recognition-using-Wav2Vec2.git)**  
  System using Wav2Vec2 to classify speech into four emotional categories (Neutral, Happy, Sad, Angry), achieving 69.02% accuracy through transformer architecture and robust data augmentation techniques.

- **[Interactive Data Breach Visualizer](https://github.com/2302660/r_team_project.git)**  
  Created an R-powered visualization dashboard of the worldâ€™s largest data breaches with advanced filtering capabilities.
